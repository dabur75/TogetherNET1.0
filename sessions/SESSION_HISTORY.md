## Development Philosophy Maintained

Throughout all sessions, the core therapeutic principles have been preserved:

1. **"Your worth is not broken - it's depleted"** - Every feature rebuilds self-worth
2. **Expansion-based methodology** - Focus on what's working, gentle curiosity
3. **Mobile-first healing** - Accessible therapeutic support anywhere, anytime
4. **Hebrew cultural authenticity** - Native therapeutic language, not translations
5. **Anti-addiction design** - Natural stopping points, no manipulation tactics

**The North Star**: Every line of code answers "Does this help someone rebuild their self-worth through daily deposits?"

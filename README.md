# TogetherNet 🏦💛

> "Your worth is not broken - it's depleted. Let's rebuild it together, one deposit at a time."

**TogetherNet** is a revolutionary therapeutic platform that systematically rebuilds self-worth through daily emotional deposits and compound emotional wealth accumulation.

## 🎯 Vision

The world's first therapeutic platform that rebuilds self-worth through daily emotional deposits, proving that technology can heal rather than harm.

## 🏦 HeartBank - The Core Innovation

At the heart of TogetherNet is **HeartBank** - a daily deposit system where users:
- Complete guided exercises published each morning at 6 AM
- Make emotional deposits across 5 categories (gratitude, courage, honesty, success, self-compassion)
- Watch their emotional wealth grow with compound interest
- Build streaks that follow natural Fibonacci patterns
- Receive therapeutic responses from the AI Banker
